#************************************************************************
#This is a gain plot configuration file. Each row contains the parameters
#for plotting a single line of antenna reflectometry data or simulations. 
#Below is a description of each column in this file.
#None of the fields should contain commas since these are used as
#column delimeters
#************************************************************************
# (1) prefix. The full or relative path and prefix to the name of the
#    simulation and/or data files.
#    For differential measurements, the file name format is assumed to be
#    <prefix>sij<postfix>_abs/pha.csv
#    where i and j range between 1 and 2 depending on the type of measurement.
#    If you are plotting the gain from a simulation,
#    the expected format of the file name is <prefix>_abs/pha.txt
# (2) The postfix of the data/simulation file name
#     (see description of column 1).
# (3) File-type. The options for this are
#     'CST_TimeTrace' for time-domain CST output
#     'CST_S11' for frequency domain S11 cst output.
#     'VNAHP_S11' for the data files written by a VNA HP8753D
#     'S11_CSV'
#     'S11_S1P' frequency dependent S11 .s1p files.
#     'ANRITSU_CSV' frequency dependent output of ANRITSU MS2024A exported 
#                   with ANRITSU master software tools.
# (4) Source-type. Specifies the source of the output. 
#     Can be one of the following.
#     'balun': VNA data taken through a balun.
#              If this is the case, information on the balun
#              files must be provided for their de-embedding
#              (see items 5 and 6).
#     'differential':Unbalanced two-port VNA measurement.
#                    If this is the case, 
#                    than the file names will include
#                    s11, s22, s21, and s12.
#     'simulation':Simulated s11 from CST. If this option is chosen,
#                  than only a single s11 amp/phase file will
#                  be expected for (1)
#                  and no postfix should be provided.
#     'baluncal':Measurement with a VNA where the calibration plane
#                is set downstream of the balun
#                (balun is calibrated out).
# (5) label. A string with no commas to be used as the label for
#            the plot line to appear in the plot legend.
# (6) color. A string specifing the color of the plot line
# (7) line-width. Width of the line to plot.
# (8) balun-prefix. The full or relative path and prefix for
#                  the name of the balun measurement/simulation files.
#                  balun file names are assumed to be
#                  <prefix>sij<postfix>_abs/pha.csv
#                  balun files should have same frequency axis as
#                  the primary measurement files.
#                  TODO: Interpolation capabilities. 
# (9) balun-postfix. The postfix component of balun
#     s-parameter file names.
# (10) port-map. A three number string indicating which ports of
#                the balun device correspond to three ports on
#                The balun with format 'ijk' where i is the port
#                corresponding to the unbalanced port on the balun
#                while ports j and k correspond to the two sides
#                of the differential port on the balun.
# (11) line style. Style to plot the line in matplotlib.
